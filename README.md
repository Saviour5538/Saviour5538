💫 About Me:
👨‍💻 I’m currently working on AI/ML projects with a strong focus on NLP, Generative AI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — building real-world applications like intelligent document chatbots and ML pipelines.
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects related to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, GenAI, and AI-powered applications where learning and impact go hand in hand.
🆘 I’m looking for help with Improving scalable ML systems, deploying AI models efficiently, and best practices in MLOps and production-ready AI.
🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG architectures, and system design for AI applications.
💬 Ask me about Machine Learning fundamentals, NLP, Deep Learning concepts, model training & evaluation, research papers, or building AI projects from scratch
⚡ Fun fact I enjoy breaking complex AI concepts into simple, beginner-friendly explanations—if I understand it well, I can teach it well 😄
